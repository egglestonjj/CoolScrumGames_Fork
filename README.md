# CoolScrumGames
CoolScrumGames Repository for SE2

"Games made by ETSU students, played by ETSU students."

## Description

CoolScrumGames is a web application that allows users to play games directly embedded into the browser. 

The web application features a home page, as well as user authentication. 

## Adding a game

Games can be added into the site using Javascript.

1. Create a folder in www/root/js for the game's javascript.
2. Create a corresponding cshtml file for the game page in pages/games.
3. Add the game's javascript as the onclick href in one of the empty buttons on the index page.


## Microservice

The microservice (TestMicroservice1) is a separate ASP.NET Web Core API that runs simultaneously with the website project.
The microservice reads a text file and writes it to the About Us page. 
The microservice connects to the website project with JavaScript on the AboutUs.cshtml page.

string getText() //This method is what pulls the data from the text file.
{
    string text = "";
    try
    {
        // Sets the path to the text file that you want to read
        string filePath = "AboutUs.txt";
        // Reads the content of the text file
        text = System.IO.File.ReadAllText(filePath);
    }
    catch (Exception ex)
    {
        Console.WriteLine("Error: " + ex.Message);
    }
    return text;
}

    return text;
